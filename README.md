## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS (Nesting and variables)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- I attempted to follow the BEM and ITCSS method to make maintenance much easier. After going back and reading more about these methods, i relaised i still have a lot to learn!

- Overall, i'm quite happy with how much little code i used to style the responsive card component.


### Continued development
- I want to focos more on BEM method and creating better naming conventions
- ITCSS - to better organise styles for websites.
- Building complex responsive layouts with flexbox and implementing CSS Grid more
